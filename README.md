# FraudShield - Fraud Detection System
FraudShield is a machine learning project designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions using behavioral and transactional data. It evaluates multiple classification models on a highly imbalanced dataset and highlights both statistical performance and real-world relevance.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview
- Developed fraud detection models using Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- Applied feature engineering, model evaluation, and performance tuning

## ðŸ“Œ Feature Importance

The most impactful features in detecting fraud were:

1. **Transaction Amount** â€“ Strongest predictor of fraud
2. **Temporal Features** â€“ Time of day, day of week, and month revealed fraud-prone periods
3. **User Age** â€“ Age patterns influenced the likelihood of fraud
4. **Transaction Category** â€“ Categories like *food/dining*, *personal care*, and *grocery* had significant fraud patterns
